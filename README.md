> This version is not yet stable.
>
> It is very important for me to maintain API compatibility provided by the Radix primitives.
> However, there are some features that I would prefer not to carry over.
> For example, the horizontal arrangement of radio buttons â€” I have indicated the reason in the code as to why this should be avoided.

> Radix-NG is an unofficial Angular port of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), thus we share the same principal and vision when building primitives.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience.
You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

Some primitives are based on [@angular/cdk](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories).
