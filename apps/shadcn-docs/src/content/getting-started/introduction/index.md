# Introduction

**Re-usable components built with Radix Angular, and Tailwind CSS.**

An unofficial, community-led [Angular](https://angular.dev) port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
We are not affiliated with **shadcn**, but we did get his blessing before creating a Angular version of his work.
This project was born out of the need for a similar project for the Angular ecosystem.
