## Anatomy

The [Theme component]() defines the overall visual look of your application. It can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component which are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants, though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.
