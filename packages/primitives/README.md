# Primitives

> Radix-NG is an unofficial Angular port of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
> thus we share the same principal and vision when building primitives.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility,
customization and developer experience.

You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.
